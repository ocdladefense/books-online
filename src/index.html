    <p>In 1977, the Oregon Legislature adopted the state’s indeterminate (parole matrix) sentencing system. Effective November 1, 1989, the legislature replaced that system with the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, a determinate sentencing system. The differences between indeterminate and determinate sentencing systems are discussed later in this chapter. Under either system:</p>

    <h1 id="oar_213_002_0001_statement_of_purposes_and_principles.">
        <strong>§ 1-1. OAR 213-002-0001 STATEMENT OF PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES.</strong>
    </h1>


    <webc-oar references="213-002-0001" chapter="213" division="002" rule="0001" target="_new">

        <p>OAR 213-002-0001 states the guidelines’ principles and purposes:</p>

        <p>(1) The primary objectives of sentencing are to punish each offender appropriately, and to insure the security of the people in person and property, within the limits of correctional resources provided by the Legislative Assembly, local governments and the people.</p>

        <p>(2) Sentencing guidelines are intended to forward the objectives described in section (1) by defining presumptive punishments for felony convictions, subject to judicial discretion to deviate for substantial and compelling reasons; and presumptive punishments for post-prison or probation supervision violations, again subject to deviation.</p>

        <p>(3) The basic principles which underlie these guidelines are:</p>

        <p>(a) The response of the corrections system to crime, and to violation of post-prison and probation supervision, must reflect the resources available for that response. A corrections system that overruns its resources is a system that cannot deliver its threatened punishment or its rehabilitative impact. This undermines the system’s credibility with the public and the offender, and vitiates the objectives of prevention of recidivism and reformation of the offender. A corrections system that overruns its resources can produce costly litigation and the threat of loss of system control to the federal judiciary. A corrections system that overruns its resources can increase the risk to life and property within the system and to the public.</p>

        <p>(b) Oregon’s current sentencing system combines indeterminate sentences with a parole matrix. Although many citizens believe the indeterminate sentence sets the length of imprisonment, that sentence only sets an offender’s maximum period of incarceration and the matrix controls actual length of stay. The frequent disparity between the indeterminate sentence length and time served under the matrix confuses and angers the public and damages the corrections system’s credibility with the public. Sentences of imprisonment should represent the time an offender will actually serve, subject only to any reduction authorized by law.</p>

        <p>(c) Under sentencing guidelines the response to many crimes will be state imprisonment. Other crimes will be punished by local penalties and restrictions imposed as part of probation. All offenders released from prison will be under post-prison supervision for a period of time. The ability of the corrections system to enforce swiftly and sternly the conditions of both probation and post-prison supervision, including by imprisonment, is crucial. Use of state institutions as the initial punishment for crime must, therefore, leave enough institutional capacity to permit imprisonment, when appropriate, for violation of probation and post-prison supervision conditions.</p>

        <p>(d) Subject to the discretion of the sentencing judge to deviate and impose a different sentence in recognition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the appropriate punishment for a felony conviction should depend on the seriousness of the crime of conviction when compared to all other crimes and the offender’s criminal history.</p>

        <p>(e) Subject to the sentencing judge’s discretion to deviate in recognition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the corrections system should seek to respond in a consistent way to like crimes combined with like criminal histories; and in a consistent way to like violations of probation and post-prison supervision conditions.</p>

    <h2 id="intent_of_provision.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.1. Intent of Provision.</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>The commentary to this provision states: “The purposes of sentencing in Oregon and the principles that guide sentencing practices to achieve those purposes are legislative issues. This provision states the State Sentencing Guidelines Board’s understanding of those purposes and principles as provided in the guidelines enabling legislation, Chapter 619, Oregon Laws 1987 (1987 legislation).” Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual 6 (1989) (hereafter Implementation Manual).</p>

    <p>Regardless of what the legislature declared are the purposes and principles of sentencing, the Oregon Constitution states its own set of principles: “Laws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal responsibility, and accountability for one’s actions and reformation.” Or Const, Art I, § 15. <em>See also</em> <span><a class="cite" references="State v. Kinkel, 184 Or App 277, 287, 56 P3d 463, 469" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Kinkel&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=13303335512445438123&amp;scilh=0" target="_new" title="View State v.

It is noteworthy that although “reformation” is a constitutionally based sentencing principle, the legislative purposes and principles do not mention it. To the extent the principles set by legislature conflict with those set by the constitution, the constitutional principles control. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <span><a class="cite" references="State v. Baker, 328 Or 355, 364, 976 P2d 1132 (1999)" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Baker&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_ylo=1998&amp;as_yhi=1999&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=16865013857854825510&amp;scilh=0" target="_new" title="View State v.

    <h2 id="punishment_and_public_safety.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.2. Punishment and Public Safety.</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>OAR 213-002-0001(1) reflects what the 1987 Legislature identified as the main purpose for sentencing, <em>i.e.</em>, “to punish each criminal offender appropriately and insure the security of the public in person and property[.]” Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(2). <em>See also</em> Or Const, Art I, § 15 (“Laws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal responsibility, and accountability for one’s actions and reformation.”). Certain appellate decisions rely on this objective in interpreting the guidelines. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <span><a class="cite" references="State v. Guthrie, 112 Or App 102, 105-06, 828 P2d 462 (1992)" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Guthrie+1992&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=8432203935641603254&amp;scilh=0" target="_new" title="View State v.

Guthrie</a>, 112 Or App 102, 105-06, 828 P2d 462 (1992)</span> (one of the principal policies underlying the guidelines “is that ranking crime seriousness provides protection from personal assault for individuals”). </p>


    <h2 id="presumptive_punishments.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.3. Presumptive Punishments.</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>Guidelines’ commentary explains that OAR 213-002-0001(2)</p>

    <p>“states the role of sentencing guidelines to define presumptive punishments subject to judicial authority to depart for substantial and compelling reasons. The enabling legislation directs the creation of guidelines which provide for ‘a sentence within the range of sanctions provided by law for the crime or crimes involved.’ [Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(1).] The 1987 legislation also provides that the court ‘may impose a sentence outside the presumptive sentence or sentence range . . . if it finds, considering the purposes of this 1987 Act, there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying a deviation from the presumptive sentence.’ [<a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="137" data-section="671" data-subsection="(1)">ORS 137.671(1)</a>].”</p>

    <p><em>Implementation Manual</em> at 6.</p>

    <p>For felony defendants, the guidelines create “presumptive” sentences, <em>i.e.</em>, sentences the law presumes are the appropriate sentences in specific cases. <em>See</em> <span><a class="cite" references="State v. Parsons, 135 Or App 188, 191, 897 P2d 1197, rev den, 322 Or 168 (1995)" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Parsons+1995&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=3344305791195113512&amp;scilh=0" target="_new" title="View State v. Parsons in Google Scholar" id="StatevParsons">State v. Parsons</a>, 135 Or App 188, 191, 897 P2d 1197, rev den, 322 Or 168 (1995)</span> (guidelines presume that most defendants will be sentenced to presumptive terms); <span><a references="State v. Woodin, 131 Or App 171, 175-76, 883 P2d 1332 (1994)" class="cite" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Woodin&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=7691503509296557371&amp;scilh=0" target="_new" title="View State v.

Woodin</a>, 131 Or App 171, 175-76, 883 P2d 1332 (1994)</span> (“[u]nder the guidelines, the maximum sentence is the presumptive sentence, unless the court finds substantial and compelling reasons to impose a departure”). </p>

    <p>OAR 213-003-0001(16) defines the term “presumptive sentence.” It states: “‘Presumptive sentence’ means the sentence provided in a grid block for an offender classified in that grid block by the combined effect of the crime seriousness ranking of the current crime of conviction and the offender’s criminal history or a sentence designated as a presumptive sentence by statute.” <em>Id</em>. Thus, presumptive sentences generally are found in the guidelines grid, but sometimes are found in special statutes. Chapter 4 discusses statutes that designate “presumptive” sentences found outside the grid.</p>

    <p>In exceptional cases, the guidelines allow the sentencing court to depart (deviate) from the presumptive sentence. <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="137" data-section="671" data-subsection="">ORS 137.671</a>. Departure sentences are discussed in Chapter 7. The sentencing court also may impose non-presumptive sentences in cases where supplemental sentencing schemes apply. These schemes also are discussed in Chapter 4.</p>


    <h2 id="basic_guidelines_principles.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.4. Basic Guidelines Principles.</strong>
    </h2>

    <p>The guidelines’ basic principles are set out at OAR 213-002-0001(3)(a)-(e). They may be summarized as economy, veracity, vindication, public safety, and consistency. These principles should be treated as context, in construing the state’s sentencing laws. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <span><a class="cite" references="State v.

    <h3 id="economy_principle.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.4.1. Economy Principle.</strong>

        <p>House Bill 5004 (enrolled as Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 468) is the 2021 Legislature’s primary measure appropriating funds to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for the 2021-23 biennium. The bill’s Section 1 appropriates from the general fund $1,974,379,412. Of that amount, $207,918,693 is for administrative-type functions. The Community Corrections Division’s portion of the total is $290,147,396, which is about 14.7% of the total general fund appropriation. Assuming 14.7% of the administrative-type functions are for the Community Corrections portion, the total cost for Community Corrections is $290,147,396 + ($207,918,693 x 14.7%) = $320,605,604. That leaves a total of $1,626,773,808 of the DOC’s general fund appropriation for imprisonment.</p>

        <p>Section 2 of HB 5004 specifies a non-general fund appropriation of $78,516,562. Of that amount, $53,240,720 is for administrative-type functions. The Community Corrections Division’s portion of the total is $6,441,863, which is about 8.2% of the total non-general fund appropriation. Assuming 8.2% of the administrative-type functions are for the Community Corrections portion, the total cost for Community Corrections is $6,441,863 + ($53,240,720 x 8.2%) = $10,807,602.

        <p>Accordingly, the combined general and non-general fund appropriations for imprisonment, for the 2021-23 biennium, is: $1,626,773,808 + 67,708,960 = $1,694,482,768. On April 1, 2022, the state Office of Economic Analysis (OEA) projected that as of July 1, 2022, the DOC would have 12,138 prison inmates.

    <p>The economy principle assumed even greater significance in 2003 when the legislature passed Senate Bill 267 (enrolled as 2003 Oregon Laws, chapter 669; partially codified at <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="515" data-subsection="">ORS 182.515</a> and 182.525). SB 267 now requires that various state agencies, including the DOC, the Oregon Youth Authority, and the Criminal Justice Commission, spend “at least 75 percent of state moneys” the agencies receive on “evidence-based programs.” <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="525" data-subsection="(1)">ORS 182.525(1)</a>.</p>

    <p>The statutory scheme defines “program” as</p>

    <webc-ors references="ORS 182.515(4)(a)" target="_new">

        <p>“a treatment or intervention program or service that is intended to:</p>

        <p>“(B) Improve the mental health of a person with the result of reducing the likelihood that the person will commit a crime[.]”</p>

    </webc-ors>

    <p>Article I, section 15, of the Oregon Constitution mandates that “[l]aws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on four principles[.]” These principles include “reformation,” <em>id.</em>, which pertains to reducing the propensity, or the likelihood, that a person will commit crimes. Imprisonment seeks to serve the reformation principle. <span><a class="cite" references="State v.

    <p>Therefore, under <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="515" data-subsection="(a)">ORS 182.515(a)</a>’s definition, imprisonment is a “program.” To ensure that the DOC meets its evidence-based program statutory mandate, a Court should impose a “program” of an extended term of imprisonment, only if that extended term is “evidence-based.”</p>

    <p><a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="515" data-subsection="(2)">ORS 182.515(2)</a> defines the second part of the “evidence-based program” definition: “Cost-effective” means that “cost savings realized over a reasonable period of time are greater than [its] costs.”</p>

    <p>Scientifically based research, in the form of sociological studies, demonstrates that a “program” of extended incarceration is not “evidence-based.” This is because such a program is as likely to increase persons’ propensity to commit crimes as it is to reduce it. This scientifically based research further shows that extended incarceration can have the effect of degenerating persons’ mental health, thereby increasing their likelihood of committing crimes. Because a program of extended incarceration has the likelihood of increasing persons’ propensity to commit crimes, including by worsening their mental health, a program of extended incarceration cannot be “cost-effective.”</p>

    <p>Consider the meta-analysis of David Roodman, <em>The Impacts of Incarceration on Crime</em> at 7, Open Philanthropy Project, Sept 2017. He explains:</p>

    <p>“[T]he question of the net impact of incarceration on crime must be brought to the data. Having reviewed and revisited published analyses in unprecedented depth, my best estimate is that the best estimate of the impact of additional incarceration on crime in the United States today is zero. And, while that estimate is not certain, there is as much reason overall to believe that <span class="underline">incarceration increases crime as decreases it</span>.”</p>

    <p>(Boldface in original; underscore added.)</p>

    <p>Dr. Oliver Roeder, <em>et al.</em>, <em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em>, Brennan Center for Justice (2015) concur. They agree that lengthy prison sentences are as likely to fail as they are to succeed in reducing crime rates:</p>

    <p>“In 2006, sociologist Bruce Western examined how incarceration influenced crime through rehabilitation, incapacitation, and deterrence. Using data through 2000, Western estimated that about 10 percent of the 1990s crime drop could be attributed to increased incarceration. To isolate the effects of incarceration, he controlled for other variables, including: spending on police, various indicators of unemployment, income inequality, racial demographics, sentencing guidelines and practices, and political parties in power. Western also made adjustments for the effect of prison on crime, which includes how prison can actually increase crime (<em>i.e.</em> upon release from prison, research shows, many individuals become more likely to commit more crime). (This effect is often referred to as the “criminogenic” effect of prison. The phenomenon of two variables that simultaneously affect one another is called a ‘simultaneity effect’ in economic analysis. * * *)”</p>

    <p><em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em> <em>Id</em>. at 20 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).</p>

    <p>Roeder, <em>et al</em>. explain the source of this criminogenic effect of prison: “Once an individual enters prison, they are surrounded by other prisoners who have often committed more serious and violent offenses. Upon release, they often have trouble finding employment and reintegrating into society due to both legal barriers and social stigma.” <em>Id</em>. at 25 (footnotes omitted).</p>

    <p>In sum, scientifically based research (sociological studies) establishes that a program of extended incarceration is not “evidence based.” <em>See also</em> Marc Mauer, <em>The Race to Incarcerate</em> 92-112 (2d ed 2006). Defense counsel should argue that, to the extent possible, courts should avoid imposing sentences that would force the DOC to violate its evidence-based program requirements under <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="525" data-subsection="(1)">ORS 182.525(1)</a>.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, <a href="#" data-action="show-ors" data-chapter="182" data-section="515" data-subsection="">ORS 182.515</a>’s definition of “scientifically based research” tracks with the definition of “scientific” evidence that is used in determining whether evidence is admissible under OEC 702. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <span><a class="cite" references="State v. Marrington, 335 Or 555, 73 P3d 911 (2003)" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10154162156262782119&amp;q=335+or.+555&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38" target="_new" title="View State v.

    <h3 id="veracity_principle_determinate_sentencing.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.4.2. Veracity Principle (Determinate Sentencing).</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>The veracity principle is set out at OAR 213-002-0001(3)(b). It is grounded on a “need for a sentencing system which provides truth-in-sentencing. Under the guidelines system, the sentence imposed will not be shortened by parole. The only term reductions permitted under the guidelines system will be those expressly provided by statute.” <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7.</p>

    <p>This principle recognizes that the guidelines represented a fundamental change in sentencing policies. The former parole matrix system is an “indeterminate sentencing” system, <em>i.e.</em>, a system in which the sentencing court</p>

    <p>“a minimum and a maximum incarceration term, allowing the possibility of release on parole between the expiration of those terms; the date and conditions of release before the maximum term is generally determined by a board of parole.</p>

    <p>“This statutory system originated in the 19th Century and rests upon the rehabilitative rationale. Since the amount of time needed to rehabilitate an offender varies with each individual and cannot be known precisely at the time of sentencing, indeterminate terms give offenders an incentive to cooperate in their rehabilitation by promising them freedom when sufficiently improved.”</p>

    <p>Campbell, § 4:2, p 105 (footnotes omitted).</p>

    <p>During the pre-guidelines era, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (then, simply called the “Parole Board”) could, and regularly did, release defendants long before they completed serving their judicially imposed maximum terms. These early releases carried a terrific political liability, which itself prompted the legislature to adopt the guidelines and to finance prison construction.</p>

    <p>Professor Kirkpatrick explains that granting early releases “created a public backlash against both the Parole Board and its matrix as defendants sentenced to prison soon reappeared in the community after serving only a fraction of their prison sentences. Thus, these early release programs gave the state corrections system the image of being a ‘revolving door.’” Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Mandatory Felony Sentencing Guidelines: The Oregon Model</em>, 25 UC Davis L Rev 695, 697 (1992) (hereafter Kirkpatrick). <em>See also</em> Kathleen M. Bogan, <em>Constructing Felony Sentencing Guidelines in an Already Crowded State: Oregon Breaks New Ground</em>, 36 Crime &amp; Delinquency 467, 474 (1990) (hereafter Bogan) (“preguidelines lengths of stay were, on the average, 24% of the judicial sentence imposed”). </p>

    <p>The guidelines system is the converse of the parole matrix system. It is a “determinate sentencing” system—one in which the court imposes sentences</p>

    <p>“whose length can be measured with relative certainty at the time they are imposed. Only credit for time served, good time, and work time can reduce the term decreed on sentencing day. * * *</p>

    <p>“Although different species abound * * * , there are two features common to all determinate sentences. First, the sentencing judge imposes a single term (instead of a minimum and maximum term as under an indeterminate system). Second, there is no subsequent parole-board decision (as with indeterminate systems) to release the prisoner earlier than the imposed term.”</p>

    <p>Campbell, § 4:3, at 110-11 (footnotes omitted).</p>

    <p>When the legislature adopted the guidelines, it simultaneously disabled the Parole Board from paroling defendants who receive guidelines sentences. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 28.

The legislature thereby ensured that subject to these two exceptions, the guidelines would be a determinate sentencing system.

    <p>A corollary of the guidelines determinate sentencing principle—that court-imposed sentences must be served—is that the court may not suspend sentence.

        <strong>§ 1-1.4.3. Vindication and Public Safety Principles.</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>OAR 213-002-0001(3)(c) and (d) set out the guidelines’ vindication and public safety principles. OAR 213-002-0001(3)(c) recognizes the principle of maintaining</p>

    <p>“enough state institutional capacity to enforce conditions of post-prison and probation supervision with prison sanctions when appropriate. This principle is inferred from (1) the 1987 legislation’s directive to include ‘the revocation of probation and subsequent incarceration’ within the scope of sentencing guidelines, [Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(1)]; and (2) the obvious need to establish effective controls over the many offenders who are supervised in the community.”</p>

    <p><em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7.</p>

    <p>Similarly, OAR 213-002-0001(3)(d) recognizes</p>

    <p>“the principle that presumptive punishments should be based on the seriousness of the crime of conviction and the offender’s criminal history. This principle recognizes that the legislature selected, from the many relevant factors cited in the 1987 legislation, ‘just deserts’ and ‘public safety’ as the primary purposes of sentencing for Oregon’s criminal justice system.”</p>

    <p><em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7 (quoting Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(a)).</p>


    <h3 id="consistency_principle.">
        <strong>§ 1-1.4.4. Consistency Principle.</strong>
    </h3>

    <p>OAR 213-002-0001(3)(e) sets out the guidelines’ consistency principle. It recognizes the need to “reduce disparity in the corrections system’s response to crime and supervision violations. The legislature stated its concern that ‘within the present system it is impossible to insure that the sentencing decisions of judges result in reasonably uniform and proportional use of state and local correctional resources.’” <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7 (quoting Or Laws 1987, ch 691, preamble).</p>

    <p>This principle could be considered a codification of the state constitutional requirement of proportionate sentences. Or Const, Art I, § 16 (“all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense”). <em>See, e.g.</em>, <span><a class="cite" references="State v.

        <div class="practice-tip">
            <span class="label">Practice Tip</span> The consistency principle recognizes the need to “reduce disparity in the corrections system’s response to crime and supervision violations. The legislature stated its concern that ‘within the present system it is impossible to insure that the sentencing decisions of judges result in reasonably uniform and <strong>proportional use of state</strong> and local correctional resources.’” <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7 (quoting Or Laws 1987, ch 691, preamble; emphasis added). Accordingly, a thorough sentencing memorandum would include a survey of sentences previously imposed in similar cases, and would recommend a sentence that is consistent with the sentences imposed in the prior cases.<br> <br>     Moreover, in cases involving racial and ethnic-minority defendants, a     thorough sentencing memorandum would describe and recommend a sentence     that avoids exacerbating the racial and ethnic disparities in Oregon’s     prison system. As The Sentencing Project explains, “sentencing advocacy     has the potential of offering prosecutors and courts an opportunity     through sentencing to offset or correct the cumulative impact of     incremental racial, ethnic or cultural disparities introduced as a     result of disparities in policing, prosecutorial charging practices, or     early court processes such as the setting of bond.” <em>The Ten Principles of Sentencing Advocacy</em> (The Sentencing Project Dec. 2003), at 6-7.<br> <br>     For comprehensive information on using racial disparities to seek     favorable sentencing decisions for African American clients, see Jesse Wm.
